Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.


solution:

def length_of_last_word(s):
    #It will Split the string into a list of words
    words = s.split()

    # It will Check if there are any words in the list
    if not words:
        return 0

    # It will Return the length of the last word
    return len(words[-1])

#input example
s = "Hello World"
result = length_of_last_word(s)
